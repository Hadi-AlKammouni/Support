Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Support app uses:

- For persistent storage (database), the project uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) which is a widely used relational database management system (RDBMS). It is free and open-source. MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) was used as backend of this project. Where Laravel is a web application php framework with expressive, elegant syntax.

- This project uses the [Angular framework](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular). Angular is a development platform, built on Typescript. As a platform, Angular includes: A component-based framework for building scalable web applications / A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more / A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code.
